1) Requirements 
    A google wave account
    A web accessible server running python2.6

2) Installation
    Via your own appspot:
    Deploy the code to your own google appserver by filling in the app.yaml provided, 
    and the google appengine sdk.

    Put wave_server_code.py on a server, fill in the settings and run.
    It is recommended not to run this as root, doing so will allow full root
    access to your server.

3) Running
    Create a new wave and add your appspot to the wave.
    Fill your details using server:http://url/port and auth:password.
    Then try an execute something on the server.

Have fun!
